XML-Parse-GlobEvents version 0.100
==================================

When people ask how to parse XML, they commonly get 2 options as an answer: SAX,
or DOM. These options are the two extremes, but neither are very practical for
every day to day use:

 * SAX remembers nothing. You only get a callback for each item (tag, text)
while the  document is being parsed. It is very memory efficient, but you, as a
programmer, are solely responsible for keeping track of where in the document
parsing process you are. It is as primitive as it can get.

 * DOM remembers everything: the whole document is parsed first, and only after
it finishes, you get a tree data structure back, that represents the whole
document.

This is a lot easier for the programmer, but if the document is quite
large, memory consumption will be humongous.

This module attempts to be a compromise between these two extremes: it is still
event based, but filtered: you get to decide what tags you're interested in, and
you get a tree representing the element structure, as a parameter.

And when you have finished processing this element tree and you will no longer use it, it is discarded, before the next section is even read in.

The module is intended to be used in a "process as you parse", with parsing
and processing interleaved.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

or use the CPAN shell.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  XML::Parser::Expat

If you don't happen have that already (it's petty standard), don't forget to
get the C library "expat" too.

RELEASE NOTES

This is a historical release. It's pretty much the module as I wrote it
in 2000-2001. It's one of the modules I have always been the most proud
of. Whenever I think of parsing XML, this module is still the module I
think of first...
